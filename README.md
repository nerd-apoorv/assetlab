# Assetlab

- Assetlab was meant to a text to game asset generator and this was the beta version of assetlab .
- I had some awesome plans and vision for assetlab but currently I have some other mess to clean up.
- So , Iam making assetlab's codes public thinking it will serve as base for the people who are planning to build a text to  asset generator .
- Let's together build this up and serve our gamedev community.
